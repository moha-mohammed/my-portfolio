                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>
                
                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This Privacy Policy explains what information I may collect from you when you visit my website, how I use that information, and what choices you have regarding that information.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Information I May Collect</h2>
                
                <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                <p>As a personal portfolio website without a contact form (per your request), I do not actively collect personal information such as your name, email address, or other contact details through forms on this website.</p>
                
                <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
                <p>Like most website operators, I may collect non-personally identifying information about visitors to my website, which may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and version</li>
                    <li>Operating system</li>
                    <li>Pages viewed on my site</li>
                    <li>Referring website</li>
                    <li>IP address (anonymized if analytics are used)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>2. How I Use Information</h2>
                <p>Any information collected is used solely for the purpose of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving the content and functionality of my portfolio website</li>
                    <li>Understanding how visitors interact with my site</li>
                    <li>Maintaining the security and integrity of the website</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>This website uses minimal cookies for essential functionality:</p>
                
                <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                <p>I use localStorage to remember your theme preference (light/dark mode). This is a browser storage mechanism that doesn't track you across websites and is only used to enhance your experience on this specific site.</p>
                
                <h3>Analytics</h3>
                <p>If I choose to implement website analytics in the future, I would use privacy-respecting options that anonymize your data. No personally identifiable information would be collected or shared with third parties.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>My portfolio contains links to third-party websites such as GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and WhatsApp. These third-party sites have their own privacy policies, and I am not responsible for their content or practices. I encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>I take reasonable measures to protect any information collected through my website. Since I don't collect personal information through forms, the risk to user data is minimal. The website is hosted with standard security practices.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>My website is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
                
                <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The date of the most recent update will be reflected at the top of this page. I encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>
                
                <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
